# NewsApp
## What is The Project About
Created a news application enabling users to browse and explore news topics spanning various categories. Employed a tech stack comprising HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, NodeJS, Express, and EJS for templating, while utilizing the [News API](https://newsapi.org/) to retrieve movie data.
## How The Project Works
The news categories available for viewing are general, business, science, technology, and health. Each page populates the news article with important information about the articles. View the entire article on the actual news source.
